# Notable-School-Projects

As I'm getting into 400 level courses (which are the most difficult for the University of Albany's Computer Science program), I find it to be a good idea to save my 
projects in a repository. This helps to build my GitHub, helps me practice using Github between my PC and laptop, and just is a marker of progress. Of course, with so many
github repositories open, each repository will probably recieve additions at a slower rate.
